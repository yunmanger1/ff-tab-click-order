Tab Click Order
===============

Firefox extension that adds a keyboard shortcut to switch back and forth between tabs in order they were clicked or activated. This extension is a fork of [Most Recent Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/most-recent-tab/). Useful to alternate between two or more tabs and to easy go back if you switch to another briefly.

If you have many tabs open, and need to switch back and forth between two or more of them, you can click through them once, and then use Ctrl+Shift+Left and Ctrl+Shift+Right to move back and forth through your tab click history. Use Ctrl+Shift+X to clear history.
